Scripts to assess partitioned heritability for tissue-specific enrichment (using GTeX tissues). Full instructions to do this are in the tutorial from Bulik-Sullivan here: https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Cell-type-specific-analyses

- **partitioned_heritability_baseline.sh** - Create the baseline LD scores needed for partitioned heritability analyses.
- **partitioned_heritability_gtex.sh** - Submit partitioned heritability analyses for GTeX tissues and the Franke lab single-cell database - these can be automatically downloaded with LDSC following instructions in the Github above.
- **plot_partitioned_heritability_gtex.R** - Scripts to plot the results as presented in the manuscript.
