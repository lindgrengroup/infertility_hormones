Scripts to assess rG of traits in our study against all phenotypes in UK Biobank, summary statistics generated by the Neale lab. 

1. **1_wget_instructions.sh** - Instructions to download Neale lab summary statistics for all UKB phenotypes with significant heritability (Z>4).
2. **2_submit_calculate_rg.R** - Loops across the heritable infertility and hormone strata to submit rG analyses separately in LDSC for each index trait. Calls **calculate_rg.sh** which loops across all the UK Biobank phenotypes within LDSC.
3. **3_plot_table_rg_results.R** - Create the plots and tables for the manuscript.
