Run co-localisation analyses of female infertility traits (1 â€”> 5, Eur and all ancestries) vs. reproductive hormones in women (Eur and all ancestries). 

Did not run co-localisation analyses for male infertility as the 3 hits we had were single SNPs rather than chimneys, and this doesn't allow us to run co-localisation analyses. 

Note that we ran for all infertility/hormone combinations the colocalisations based on the same combined list of sentinel SNPs for all infertility and hormone traits. This list contains all sentinel SNPs for infertility and/or hormones, distance clumped at 100kb to avoid double running regions
